This folder contains the summary notes about the topics covered in the workshop.
The notes can be opened on MATLAB as livescripts.

I would advise you to go through the files in the following order:
1. Intro2MATLAB
2. ImportData
3. Loops
4. Making Choices
5. Functions Challenge

If you have any version of MATLAB befor 2016a and can not open livescript files please contact me.
